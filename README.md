## Features

- Hosts (teachers) can create new chat rooms, providing a platform for collaboration and communication.
- Users can join or leave existing chat rooms as participants (students and teacher).
- Students and teacher can send and receive messages in their rooms.
- Participants can reconnect to a room if they temporarily lose connection, ensuring continuity in communication.
- Teachers can initiate and terminate code sharing sessions, allowing participants to collaborate on code in real-time.
- Students can send files (code snippets, documents) to the teacher during code sharing sessions, promoting efficient
  collaboration.
